        risks: ["A surge in heatstroke and dehydration cases", "The spread of heat-related infectious diseases", "Worsening mental health outcomes and stress"],
        responses: {
          "A surge in heatstroke and dehydration cases": "Your focus on <strong>heatstroke and dehydration</strong> is at the sharp end of the heat crisis. This acute health emergency is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> A lack of accessible public cooling centers and insufficient green cover in low-income neighborhoods directly contributes to higher rates of heatstroke. <br><br><strong>Community Development:</strong> Socially isolated individuals, particularly the elderly, are less likely to receive help during heatwaves, turning a medical condition into a fatal social failure.",
          "The spread of heat-related infectious diseases": "Your focus on <strong>infectious diseases</strong> reveals a hidden amplifier of the heat crisis. The expansion of zones for vectors like mosquitoes is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Poor management of urban water bodies and drainage systems creates new breeding grounds for disease vectors. <br><br><strong>Corporate Operations:</strong> Increased global shipping can transport vectors to new, now-suitable climates, impacting trade and public health.",
          "Worsening mental health outcomes and stress": "Your focus on <strong>mental health</strong> highlights a deeply personal impact of heat. This 'eco-anxiety' is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Corporate Operations:</strong> Financial instability caused by heat-related job losses (e.g., in construction) is a primary driver of community-wide stress. <br><br><strong>Community Development:</strong> The loss of communal public spaces to extreme heat leads to social isolation, further exacerbating mental health challenges."
        }
      },
      "Urban Planning": {
        risks: ["Critical failure of the power grid during peak demand", "Severe water scarcity and rationing", "Degradation and underutilization of public spaces"],
        responses: {
          "Critical failure of the power grid during peak demand": "Your focus on <strong>power grid failure</strong> highlights a critical infrastructure vulnerability. This is not just a technical issue; it's systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Corporate Operations:</strong> Grid failure leads to immediate and costly business interruptions, halting production and services. <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> A power outage during a heatwave is a life-threatening emergency, disabling essential cooling for vulnerable populations and compromising the functioning of hospitals.",
          "Severe water scarcity and rationing": "Your focus on <strong>water scarcity</strong> exposes the deep connection between heat and resource security. This critical shortage is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> Lack of clean water for hygiene and hydration during heatwaves leads to a surge in public health crises. <br><br><strong>Corporate Operations:</strong> Water-intensive industries, from manufacturing to agriculture, face operational shutdowns and financial losses, threatening economic stability.",
          "Degradation and underutilization of public spaces": "Your focus on the <strong>degradation of public spaces</strong> uncovers a key threat to urban quality of life. The loss of these areas is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Community Development:</strong> When parks become unusable due to heat, it erodes social cohesion and disproportionately affects those without private gardens. <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> The decline of walkable, green public spaces contributes to more sedentary lifestyles and worsens mental health outcomes for urban populations."
        }
      },
      "Corporate Operations": {
        risks: ["Reduced labor productivity due to heat stress", "Major supply chain and logistics disruptions", "Damage to physical assets and infrastructure"],
        responses: {
          "Reduced labor productivity due to heat stress": "Your focus on <strong>labor productivity</strong> is a critical economic entry point to the heat crisis. This is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> The same heat stress that reduces productivity also leads to higher rates of chronic illness and emergency room visits, increasing public health costs. <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> The 'Urban Heat Island' effect, caused by a lack of green cover in industrial and residential areas, can raise local temperatures by 5-10Â°C, directly impacting your workforce.",
          "Major supply chain and logistics disruptions": "Your focus on <strong>supply chain disruptions</strong> reveals how heat can cripple the flow of commerce. This logistical challenge is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Extreme heat damages critical transport infrastructure like roads and railways, while low water levels can halt shipping, causing delays. <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> A health crisis among transport workers or in key port cities can bring logistics to a standstill, with cascading economic effects.",
          "Damage to physical assets and infrastructure": "Your focus on <strong>damage to physical assets</strong> highlights the direct financial costs of heat. This is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Inadequate building codes and poor zoning fail to protect infrastructure from heat-related material stress, from melting asphalt to warping railway lines. <br><br><strong>Community Development:</strong> Siting critical assets without community consultation can lead to opposition, delaying vital infrastructure upgrades needed for resilience."
        }
      },
      "Community Development": {
        risks: ["Increased inequality and impacts on vulnerable groups", "Disruption of informal livelihoods and economies", "Erosion of social cohesion and community trust"],
        responses: {
          "Increased inequality and impacts on vulnerable groups": "Your focus on <strong>inequality</strong> is at the moral center of the heat crisis. The disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> Unequal access to healthcare and affordable cooling means that low-income households suffer far greater health consequences from extreme heat. <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> A historical lack of investment in green infrastructure in marginalized neighborhoods concentrates heat where people are least able to cope.",
          "Disruption of informal livelihoods and economies": "Your focus on <strong>informal livelihoods</strong> protects the backbone of many local economies. This vital sector is threatened and systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> The lack of shaded, cool public markets and spaces makes it impossible for street vendors and daily wage laborers to work safely during extreme heat. <br><br><strong>Corporate Operations:</strong> As formal sector supply chains are disrupted, it can create supply-and-demand shocks that destabilize the informal economies that rely on them.",
          "Erosion of social cohesion and community trust": "Your focus on <strong>social cohesion</strong> addresses the fraying of the social fabric due to heat. This erosion of trust is systemically linked to: <br><br><strong>Public Health:</strong> Perceived inequality in emergency response and access to cooling resources can breed resentment and undermine public trust in institutions. <br><br><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Top-down planning of 'resilience' projects that lead to green gentrification can displace long-term residents, destroying community bonds and trust."
